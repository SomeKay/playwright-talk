## Writing (or rather generating) first test 🎨

Playwright provides the Playwright Inspector.
Even though that tool has different functionalities, one
of them allows E2E test code to be generated by clicking.

### Hands-on 👨‍💻

1. Use Codegen to quickly generate some tests
   - Run `npx playwright codegen`
   - For this demonstration the URL is `https://www.saucedemo.com`
2. Copy the tests into a new spec file
3. Run the tests in headed mode to see Playwright performing actions
   - Run `npx playwright test --headed`
   - Run `npx playwright test --debug` to Analyze Tests with the Playwright Inspector
   - Use `page.pause()` to set a debug point (only in Debug Mode)
