## Writing (or rather generating) first test ðŸŽ¨

1. Use Codegen to quickly generate some tests
   - Run `npx playwright codegen {YOUR_URL}`
   - For this demonstration the URL is `https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc`
2. Copy the tests into a new spec file
3. Run the tests in headed mode to
   - Run `npx playwright test --headed`
   - Run `npx playwright test --debug` to Analyze Tests with the Playwright Inspector
   - Use `page.pause()` to set a debug point (only in Debug Mode)
