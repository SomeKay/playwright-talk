## Cleaning up Tests 🧹

Playwright encourages clean test code by using Page Object Models.
A Page Object is a self-contained part of a web application encapsulating
and abstracting its parts and functionalities.

### Hands-on 👨‍💻

1. Create a Page Object for the page we are visiting
2. What functionality to extract into the Page Object
   - Navigation to the page
     - Usually a `goto` method
   - Locators
     - Makes usage of same Locators in multiple tests easier
     - Allows much easier refactoring of Locator Selectors
   - Actions
     - Improves readability of tests considerably
3. Use the Page Object and make the Tests much better
