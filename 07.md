## Cleaning up Tests ðŸ§¹

1. Create a Page Object for the page we are visiting
2. Extract functionality into the Page Object
  - Navigation to the page
    - Usually a `goto` method
  - Locators
    - If we need the same Locators in multiple tests
    - If we need to change Locator Selectors
  - Actions
    - To make our tests easier to read
3. Use the Page Object and make our Tests readable
