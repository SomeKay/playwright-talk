## Logging in only once 🔑

One typical case of making tests run considerably faster
and cleaning up code is by only logging in once. Playwright
provides support for Logins to be stored before running tests.

### Hands-on 👨‍💻

1. Add a Setup Script file (e.g. `global-setup.ts`)
  - the Script performs a Login and stores user data (Cookies and Storage) into a file
2. Include the Setup Script and provide the data to tests in your Config file
  - The data will be loaded automatically
