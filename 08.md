## Knowing why Tests are failing ðŸ¤¬

### Typical problems ðŸ¤”

- `waiting for selector "SELECTOR"`
  - A selector timed out
  - Check if there is a misspelling of the selector
  - Check if the element is there (debug mode)
- `strict mode violation: "SELECTOR" resolved to 3 elements`
  - An operation (like `fill`) was executed on a Selector which delivers more than 1 result
  - Getting multiple results is fine for filtering or traversal purposes
  - Try to always operate on only 1 element (unless the test needs more)

### What to do ðŸŽ“

- Look at what the reporter is saying
- Check the screenshot and video
- Use debug mode
- Analyze the trace
  - Send the trace to a colleague for help
  - Watch out: passwords can be read in plain text
