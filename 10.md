## Some tips ðŸ¤“

- Traversing to a parent element
  - Use the XPATH Selector:
    `page.locator('#someElement').locator('xpath=..')`
- Use ESLint to assure that all Promises are awaited properly
  - Add `"@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises": ["error"]` to your ESLint `rules`
- Store sensitive and environment specific data into Environment Variables
  - Tests with Playwright have full access to `process` and can read that data
